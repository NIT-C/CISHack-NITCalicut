# Foxtrot Courses
This project aims at creating a comminity based learning platform.

This is based on a simple points based system. All users on the platform can create courses to teach their courses.
- Users earn points when their course gets an upvote and lose points when they get a downvote.
- Users can use these points to access other courses and learn.

Hence, everyone teaches and everyone learns.
